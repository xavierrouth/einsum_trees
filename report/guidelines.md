Goal
The primary goal of the final project is to give you experience with developing inside a machine learning compiler
or using machine learning to improve compiler optimizations. A secondary goal is to give you exposure to topics
of current research interests in the compiler area – you are welcome (and highly encouraged) to include a research
component in your project!

Wednesday, December 10* (Project Report and Code): 70% of the grade
Both the report and the code will be submitted via Gradescope.
The report should be 4-5 pages (two column format), not including References and Appendix. Refer to Latex
style files in the ASPLOS conference series (using acmart template; see Formatting and Editing Section under
https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2025/cfp/). Here is a possible breakdown of sections. You
are not required to stick to this structure.
The report should include:
1. The problem statement and motivation (1/2 page).
2. Brief summary of existing work in the literature, with citations (1/2 page).
3. High-level overview of your algorithm or design (1 page).
4. Implementation and evaluation (1 page):
(a) How you implemented your algorithms in your framework of choice. Major code components (passes,
data structures, and functions).
(b) Experimental setup
(c) Experiment descriptions and results
Your project code and experimental data should be submitted as a zip archive. The code should contain
instructions for installing and running the project (except special cases when there is a strict reason for why
it is not possible, which should have been discussed with the course staff ahead of time). We will not assign
partial credit for non-working code.
